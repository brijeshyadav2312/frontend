		Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is an Italian dish consisting of a usually round,
		flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other
		ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked
		at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a
		pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

		In Italy, pizza served in formal settings, such as at a restaurant, is presented unsliced, and is eaten
		with the use of a knife and fork.[2][3] In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten
		while held in the hand.

	<p style="color: green; text-align: center; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
		A hamburger (or burger for short) is a food, typically considered a sandwich, consisting of one or more cooked
		patties—usually ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be pan
		fried, grilled, smoked or flame broiled. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion,
		pickles, bacon, or chilis; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, or a "special sauce", often
		a variation of Thousand Island dressing; and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger topped with
		cheese is called a cheeseburger.[1]

		The term burger can also be applied to the meat patty on its own, especially in the United Kingdom, where the
		term patty is rarely used, or the term can even refer simply to ground beef. Since the term hamburger usually
		implies beef, for clarity burger may be prefixed with the type of meat or meat substitute used, as in beef
		burger, turkey burger, bison burger, portobello burger, or veggie burger.

	<p style="color: green; text-align: center; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
		A soft drink (see § Terminology for other names) is a drink that usually contains water (often carbonated), a
		sweetener, and a natural and/or artificial flavoring. The sweetener may be a sugar, high-fructose corn syrup,
		fruit juice, a sugar substitute (in the case of diet drinks), or some combination of these. Soft drinks may also
		contain caffeine, colorings, preservatives, and/or other ingredients.

		Soft drinks are called "soft" in contrast with "hard" alcoholic drinks. Small amounts of alcohol may be present
		in a soft drink, but the alcohol content must be less than 0.5% of the total volume of the drink in many
		countries and localities[1][2] if the drink is to be considered non-alcoholic.[3] Fruit punch, tea (even
		kombucha), and other such non-alcoholic drinks are technically soft drinks by this definition, but are not
		generally referred to as such.

		Soft drinks may be served cold, over ice cubes, or at room temperature. They are available in many container
		formats, including cans, glass bottles, and plastic bottles. Containers come in a variety of sizes, ranging from
		small bottles to large multi-liter containers. Soft drinks are widely available at fast food restaurants, movie
		theaters, convenience stores, casual-dining restaurants, dedicated soda stores, vending machines, and bars from
		soda fountain machines. Soft drinks are usually served in paper or plastic disposable cups in the first three
		venues. In casual dining restaurants and bars, soft drinks are often served in glasses made from glass or
		plastic. Soft drinks may be drunk with straws or sipped directly from the cups.
